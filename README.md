# Health Insurance Auto Approval

## Overview
The primary purpose of this project is to automate prior authorization approvals using machine learning. By leveraging historical data and predictive analytics, we aim to streamline the process of determining whether a prior authorization request should be approved. This automation will help reduce the manual workload on veterinary staff and speed up the overall health isnsurance approval process.

* Merging of data - By combining the Prior Authorization Data and Claims Data, we get a complete picture of what affects prior authorization decisions. The Prior Authorization Data shows us the requests made and their results, while the Claims Data gives context about the medical procedures done and the pets' medical history.

* Data Preprocessing -
Handled Duplicates: Removed duplicate rows
Standardize Provider Information: Created 'Standardized_Provider' column, Removed redundant provider columns
Date Formatting: Converted 'submission_date' and 'Claim Date' to datetime
Feature Engineering: Extracted month, day, and weekday from submission date, Created binary flag for clinical reviewer presence
Encode Categorical Variables:Used Label Encoding for 'service' and 'Standardized_Provider'
Handle Missing Values: Filled NaN values in 'authstatus' with 'Pending', Imputed missing numerical values with median
Feature Selection: Selected relevant features- service, submission details, amount paid, unit, provider
Data Normalization: Applied StandardScaler to numerical features

* EDA - EDA allowed us to spot trends, understand data distributions, and check for any anomalies or outliers. 

* Conclusion - In conclusion, this project successfully developed a predictive model to streamline prior authorization approvals, allowing Cohere Pets to make faster and more accurate decisions in veterinary care. Through exploratory data analysis, we identified important trends and influential features that impact approval outcomes, enabling us to better understand and optimize the authorization process. The modelâ€™s insights have the potential to reduce delays, improve client satisfaction, and create cost savings by automating routine decisions. Moving forward, incorporating additional data and continuously refining the model will help maintain its effectiveness and adaptability, further solidifying Cohere Pets' position as a leader in technology-driven veterinary care.
